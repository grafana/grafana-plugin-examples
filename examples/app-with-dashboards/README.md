# Grafana App Plugin Template

This template is a starting point for building an app plugin for Grafana.

## What are Grafana app plugins?

App plugins can let you create a custom out-of-the-box monitoring experience by custom pages, nested datasources and panel plugins.

## Getting started

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode or run in watch mode

   ```bash
   yarn dev

   # or

   yarn watch
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

4. Run the tests (using Jest)

   ```bash
   # Runs the tests and watches for changes
   yarn test

   # Exists after running all the tests
   yarn lint:ci
   ```

5. Spin up a Grafana instance and run the plugin inside it (using Docker)

   ```bash
   yarn server
   ```

6. Run the E2E tests (using Cypress)

   ```bash
   # Spin up a Grafana instance first that we tests against
   yarn server

   # Start the tests
   yarn e2e
   ```

7. Run the linter

   ```bash
   yarn lint

   # or

   yarn lint:fix
   ```
